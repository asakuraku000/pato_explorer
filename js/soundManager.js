 * SOUND MANAGER — Pato Explorer
 * ============================================================================
 * One shared place for every sound the game plays. Scenes call the helper
 * methods below (SoundManager.playMusic / SoundManager.play) instead of
 * dealing with Phaser's sound API directly.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * >>> YOUR TASK <<<
 * Drop your audio files into  assets/audio/  and RENAME each one to match
 * the filenames on the left below EXACTLY (same spelling, same case,
 * same .mp3 extension). Nothing else needs to change — PreloadScene already
 * points at these exact names, so as soon as a file with the right name
 * shows up, it just starts working.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   assets/audio/bg-menu.mp3        Looping music for the MAIN MENU screen.
 *                                   Something calm/inviting — this is the
 *                                   first thing the player hears.
 *
 *   assets/audio/bg-game.mp3        Looping music for ALL gameplay — the
 *                                   Prologue and every Chapter (1–5) share
 *                                   this one track so the mood stays
 *                                   consistent while exploring/talking/
 *                                   building. Loop it seamlessly if you can.
 *
 *   assets/audio/sfx-click.mp3      Short "tap"/"tick" sound (under half a
 *                                   second). Plays on EVERY button press in
 *                                   the game — menu, settings, quiz answers,
 *                                   popups — and every time dialogue
 *                                   advances. This is the one you'll hear
 *                                   most, so keep it short and unobtrusive.
 *
 *   assets/audio/sfx-correct.mp3    Short positive "ding"/chime — plays when
 *                                   the player picks the right quiz answer.
 *
 *   assets/audio/sfx-incorrect.mp3  Short negative "buzz"/soft thud — plays
 *                                   when the player picks the wrong answer.
 *                                   (Keep it gentle, not punishing — this is
 *                                   an educational game, wrong answers just
 *                                   show the explanation and move on.)
 *
 *   assets/audio/sfx-complete.mp3   A little triumphant jingle (1–3 sec) —
 *                                   plays when a chapter is finished and the
 *                                   "Journal Page Unlocked!" panel appears.
 *
 *   assets/audio/sfx-curtain-close.mp3  A cloth "swish"/whoosh — plays the
 *                                   instant the theater-curtain panels start
 *                                   sliding IN to cover the screen (leaving
 *                                   a scene, e.g. Menu -> Prologue/Chapter).
 *
 *   assets/audio/sfx-curtain-open.mp3   Same idea, reversed — plays as the
 *                                   panels slide back OUT to reveal a scene
 *                                   that's just starting. Totally fine to
 *                                   use the same recording for both (just
 *                                   copy it twice under the two names) if
 *                                   you don't have distinct open/close foley.
 *
 *   assets/audio/sfx-type-blip.mp3  A VERY short (<80ms) "blip"/"blorp" —
 *                                   the classic Animal-Crossing-style
 *                                   gibberish talking sound. It replays once
 *                                   per letter while dialogue is typing
 *                                   itself out, so keep it tiny and
 *                                   non-fatiguing since it repeats a LOT.
 *
 *   assets/audio/sfx-footsteps.mp3  A soft, seamlessly-loopable footstep
 *                                   pattern (a couple of steps long is
 *                                   plenty). Starts the instant the player
 *                                   starts walking in the Prologue/any
 *                                   Chapter/the Sandbox, and loops for as
 *                                   long as they keep moving - stops the
 *                                   moment they let go of the keys (or
 *                                   dialogue/a cutscene takes over).
 *
 * That's 10 files total: 3 loops + 7 short one-shot effects.
 *
 * SAFE-BY-DEFAULT: if a file above is missing/not renamed yet, Phaser just
 * fails to load THAT one file quietly — the rest of the game keeps running
 * normally, it just plays silence for that spot. So you can add these one at
 * a time and test as you go; nothing will crash or block your build.
 *
 * Using a different format (.ogg / .wav)? Just change the extension in the
 * `path` values in SOUND_FILES below to match what you actually add.
